I hold an M.Sc. in Computer Science, where my research focused on the **mathematical analysis of learning dynamics in Spiking Neural Networks**. My thesis established convergence guarantees for STDP-based learning in recurrent architectures using Lyapunov stability theory and dynamical systems analysis. This work reinforced my commitment to understanding the **theoretical foundations of learning**—not merely what works in practice, but the fundamental principles that govern adaptation in neural systems.

I am seeking a **Ph.D. position** to pursue rigorous research at the intersection of **learning theory, optimization, and neural computation**, with the goal of developing algorithms that are both theoretically grounded and practically effective.

## Research Projects

### DeFi Liquidation Risk Analysis: A Case Study on the Aave Protocol
*Present*

This project tackles the critical issue of liquidation risk within the Aave protocol by developing a predictive model based on on-chain data. I am engineering a robust data pipeline to ingest and process historical loan positions from the Polygon blockchain, focusing on key indicators like the Health Factor. The prototype model can already identify over **85% of at-risk accounts 24 hours in advance**. Current research is aimed at improving model resilience to market shocks and understanding the systemic effects of liquidation cascades.

### Neuromorphic Real-Time Anomaly Detection for Cryptocurrency Markets
*Present*

Leveraging the computational efficiency of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), this project introduces a novel system for real-time anomaly detection in cryptocurrency markets. I am designing a custom SNN in snnTorch to identify complex manipulative trading patterns from high-resolution, tick-by-tick data. Initial simulations demonstrate the potential for **sub-50ms detection latencies** and a significant reduction in synaptic operations (SynOps) over traditional RNNs. Current efforts focus on scaling the model with a large-scale dataset and exploring deployment on specialized neuromorphic hardware.
