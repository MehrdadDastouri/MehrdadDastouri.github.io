    "summary": "I hold an M.Sc. in Computer Science, where my research focused on the mathematical analysis of learning dynamics in Spiking Neural Networks. My thesis established convergence guarantees for STDP-based learning in recurrent architectures using Lyapunov stability theory and dynamical systems analysis. This work reinforced my commitment to understanding the theoretical foundations of learning—not merely what works in practice, but the fundamental principles that govern adaptation in neural systems. I am seeking a Ph.D. position to pursue rigorous research at the intersection of learning theory, optimization, and neural computation, with the goal of developing algorithms that are both theoretically grounded and practically effective.",
