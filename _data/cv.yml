- title: About
  type: text
  contents: >
    I hold an M.Sc. in Computer Science, where my research focused on the mathematical analysis of learning dynamics in Spiking Neural Networks. My thesis established convergence guarantees for STDP-based learning in recurrent architectures using Lyapunov stability theory and dynamical systems analysis. This work reinforced my commitment to understanding the theoretical foundations of learningâ€”not merely what works in practice, but the fundamental principles that govern adaptation in neural systems. I am seeking a Ph.D. position to pursue rigorous research at the intersection of learning theory, optimization, and neural computation, with the goal of developing algorithms that are both theoretically grounded and practically effective.

      year: 2016 - Present
      description:
        - Designed and deployed end-to-end, computationally-efficient AI/ML solutions for global clients, managing projects across domains like FinTech and IoT.
        - '<strong>LLM-Powered DeFi Risk Analysis Agent:</strong> Architected an AI agent with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture using LangChain and FAISS to provide a natural language interface for a complex DeFi liquidation risk model. The agent translates complex on-chain metrics into actionable, human-readable reports, reducing time-to-insight for financial analysts by over 90%. Deployed the solution as a scalable RESTful API using FastAPI, containerized with Docker.'
        - '<strong>Neuromorphic Anomaly Detection for Crypto Trading:</strong> Engineered a real-time anomaly detection system for high-frequency crypto data, replacing a costly RNN with a custom Spiking Neural Network (SNN). Achieved a ~15% reduction in latency and a ~40% decrease in energy consumption. Delivered the model as a containerized (Docker) API using Flask.'
        - '<strong>End-to-End EMG Gesture Recognition for Prosthetics:</strong> Led the development of a hybrid CNN-LSTM pipeline for classifying hand gestures from EMG signals, achieving >95% accuracy and <50ms latency. Managed the full project lifecycle from data preprocessing to optimization for a next-generation prosthetic control system.'
        - '<strong>Optimized Time-Series Forecasting for Energy Grids:</strong> Developed and deployed an end-to-end LSTM-based platform to predict energy consumption for smart grids, achieving >90% forecast accuracy. Created a lightweight version with a 30% reduced memory footprint for IoT hardware deployments.'
